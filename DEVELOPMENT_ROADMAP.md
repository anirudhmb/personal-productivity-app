# Development Roadmap - Personal Productivity App

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Strategy

### **Approach: MVP-First, Iterative Development**
1. **Start with MVP** - Core functionality that demonstrates the concept
2. **Build incrementally** - Add features one at a time
3. **Test frequently** - Run the app after each major feature
4. **Iterate based on usage** - Refine based on actual usage patterns

### **Technology Stack Decisions**

#### **Frontend** (Enhanced Vanilla JS)
- **Keep current setup**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (as per existing Tauri template)
- **Add lightweight enhancements**:
  - CSS Grid/Flexbox for layouts
  - CSS Custom Properties for theming
  - Simple state management (localStorage + custom state manager)
- **Consider adding**: Alpine.js for reactive components (optional)

#### **Backend** (Rust + SQLite)
- **Database**: SQLite (embedded, no external dependencies)
- **ORM**: `diesel` for type-safe database operations
- **Serialization**: `serde` for JSON handling
- **Date/Time**: `chrono` for date handling
- **File handling**: `tauri-plugin-fs` for file operations

## ðŸ“‹ Development Phases

- [ ] Implement tag system for journal entries
- [ ] Create journal entry search functionality
- [ ] Add date range filtering

#### **Step 11: Dashboard**
- [ ] Create overview dashboard
- [ ] Add persona cards with progress indicators
- [ ] Implement recent activity feed
- [ ] Add upcoming deadlines display

### **Phase 3: Polish & Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)**

#### **Step 12: Cross-Persona Habit Dashboard**
- [ ] Create global habit overview
- [ ] Implement habit streak leaderboard
- [ ] Add habit completion analytics
- [ ] Build bulk habit completion interface

#### **Step 13: Advanced Filtering & Search**
- [ ] Implement complex journal filtering
- [ ] Add global search across all content
- [ ] Create saved filter presets
- [ ] Add export functionality

#### **Step 14: Data Management**
- [ ] Implement data export (JSON/CSV)
- [ ] Add data import functionality
- [ ] Create backup/restore features
- [ ] Add data validation and error handling

#### **Step 15: UI/UX Polish**
- [ ] Implement dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling

## ðŸ›  Implementation Approach

### **Development Principles**
- **Test frequently**: Run `npm run tauri dev` after each major change
- **Commit often**: Small, focused commits for each feature
- **Start simple**: Build basic functionality first, enhance later
- **Focus on one feature at a time**: Complete each step before moving to the next
- **Use the existing Tauri structure**: Build on what's already working

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Choose your starting point**:
   - Option A: Start with database setup (recommended)
   - Option B: Start with basic UI structure
   - Option C: Start with a specific feature you're most excited about

2. **Set up development environment**:
   - Ensure Tauri dev environment is working
   - Set up database dependencies
   - Create basic project structure

3. **Begin with MVP features**:
   - Persona management
   - Basic workstream creation
   - Simple task tracking
   - Basic habit check-ins

### **Development Tips**

1. **Test frequently**: Run `npm run tauri dev` after each major change
2. **Commit often**: Small, focused commits for each feature
3. **Start simple**: Build basic functionality first, enhance later
4. **Focus on one feature at a time**: Complete each step before moving to the next
5. **Use the existing Tauri structure**: Build on what's already working

### **Estimated Timeline**

- **MVP (Phase 1)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Enhanced Features (Phase 2)**: 2-3 weeks  
- **Polish & Advanced (Phase 3)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Total**: 6-9 weeks for full implementation

### **Success Metrics**

- [ ] Can create and manage personas
- [ ] Can create workstreams within personas
- [ ] Can track project tasks (basic list view)
- [ ] Can log daily habits with quantity tracking
- [ ] Can write and filter journal entries
- [ ] App runs smoothly without crashes
- [ ] Data persists between app restarts
